* Project Description
This is a study of the <skiplist> Data Structure.
This is a =LiterateProgramming= 'orgumentary'.

* c++ build <Remarks>
So, this is a flat-file working version of the basic setup which produces a .clang-complete and a
compile-commands.json. To get this, run firstCmake.sh in the terminal before opening the project
in spacemacs.

In .dir-locals.el:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(projectile-project-configure-cmd . "CXX='cc_args.py g++' cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=Yes -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG . && make")
#+END_SRC
..does not seem to be working yet
Or does it get set too late?

Either way, I will now work to create out-of-tree builds on a different branch "ootb".

Ok, build dir is operational. Now I need to make sure flycheck is happy.
